/**
 * Represents an opinion tuple.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An opinion is a statement about trust that was given by one agent about a
 * third party to agent Alpha. We denote an opinion as a 5-tuple (agent1,
 * agent2, service, time, internalTrustDegree), where each member has the
 * following meaning.
 * <ul>
 * <li>int: agent1 -- represents the agent that provides the opinion to agent
 * Alpha
 * <li>int: agent2 -- represents the agent which the opinion is about
 * <li>int: service -- represents the of service for which the opinion is about
 * <li>int: time -- represents the time at which the opinion was given
 * <li>double internalTrustDegree -- represents the reported level of trust of
 * agent1 towards agent2. This value falls under [0, 1], where 1 is the best
 * possible value and 0 is the worst possible value.
 * </ul>
