/**
 * <h1>The Alpha Testbed</h1>
 * <p>
 * The testbed that performs the evaluation. It has two modes of operation, the
 * <b>ranking mode</b> and the <b>utility mode</b>. The execution flow of the
 * testbed and the data it contains depend on the mode the testbed is in.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The testbed publishes the results of the evaluation by using subscribers.
 * Subscribers are instances of classes that implement the
 * {@link IMetricSubscriber} interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The results are published in the following manner. First, the subscribers
 * have to subscribe to the testbed by using
 * {@link #subscribe(IMetricSubscriber)} method. Second, at the end of each
 * evaluation step, the testbed notifies all subscribers by invoking their
 * {@link IMetricSubscriber#update(AlphaTestbed)} methods. Finally, the
 * subscribers are expected to pull the results of the evaluation via the
 * {@link #getMetric(int, IMetric)} method.
 * 
 * <h2>Ranking mode</h2>
 * <p>
 * In ranking mode, the testbed treats the trust model as a black box. This
 * means that the testbed generates the complete data that is given to the trust
 * model. The testbed then evaluates trust model's output. This is achieved by
 * evaluating rankings of agents that emerge from the computed trust degrees.
 * The general execution flow is the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The testbed sets time in the scenario.
 * <li>The testbed sets time in the trust model.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the scenario to generate opinions.
 * <li>The testbed conveys generated opinions to the trust model.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the scenario to generate experiences.
 * <li>The testbed conveys generated experiences to the trust model.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the trust model to evaluate trust.
 * <li>The testbed instruct the trust model to compute rankings of agents.
 * <li>The testbed evaluates received rankings. /ol>
 * <p>
 * The last two steps are repeated for every type of service. Finally, the
 * subscribers are asked to retrieve the results.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In ranking mode, the testbed holds a reference to instances of a
 * {@link ITrustModel}, a {@link IScenario}, and a {@link IRankingMetric}. Other
 * class members are set to null or ignored.
 * 
 * <h2>Utility mode</h2>
 * <p>
 * In utility mode, the testbed treats the trust model as a cognitive entity.
 * This means that the trust model is required to select partners for
 * interactions, whereas in ranking mode the testbed (or the scenario) was
 * responsible for selecting interaction partners. Besides measuring the
 * correctness of rankings, the testbed in utility mode also measures the
 * utility that the trust model obtains in interactions during evaluation. The
 * general execution flow is the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The testbed sets time in the scenario.
 * <li>The testbed sets time in the trust model.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the scenario to generate opinions.
 * <li>The testbed conveys generated opinions to the trust model.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the trust model to tell, whom does agent Alpha want
 * to interact with.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the scenario to generate experiences tuples for
 * agents that the trust model requested.
 * <li>The testbed conveys generated experiences to the trust model.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the trust model to evaluate trust.
 * <li>The testbed instructs the trust model to compute rankings of agents.
 * <li>The testbed evaluates received rankings.
 * <li>The testbed evaluates the utility which was obtained from interactions.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The last three steps are repeated for every type of service. Finally, the
 * subscribers are asked to retrieve the results.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In utility mode, the testbed reference to the same instances as in ranking
 * mode (an instance of {@link ITrustModel}, {@link IScenario}, and
 * {@link IRankingMetric}). Besides those, the utility mode also references an
 * implementation of an {@link IDecisionMaking} interface (part of a trust model
 * that selects interaction partners), an {@link IPartnerSelection} interface
 * implementation (part of scenario that receives the partner selections and
 * prepares corresponding {@link Experience} tuples) and an instance of a
 * {@link IUtilityMetric} to evaluate the obtained utility. Because the
 * {@link IUtilityMetric} is stateful (and the state is different for every
 * service), we need to have an instance of such {@link IUtilityMetric} instance
 * for every possible type of service. The testbed stores all those instances in
 * the map of type {@link Map}<{@link Integer}, {@link IUtilityMetric}>, because
 * they track state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The testbed must be instantiated and run by a simulation platform, such as
 * Repast.
