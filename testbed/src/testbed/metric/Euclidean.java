/**
 * Euclidean difference between calculated trust values and capabilities.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The metric calculates the Euclidean distance between the actual capabilities
 * and the calculated trust values. The trust values have to be expressed in
 * floating point numbers from [0, 1].
 * 
 * <p>
 * This metric is different from other metrics in several aspects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It requires that trust is expressed in floating point numbers between 0
 * and 1, inclusively.
 * <li>It has a minimum value, but no maximum value.
 * <li>It is inverted -- small values mean better results. Consequently, the
 * minimum value also represents the perfect score (a trust model that would
 * compute trust values that are exactly the same as the actual capabilities
 * would achieve the score of 0.)
 * </ul>
