# Alpha Testbed

Alpha testbed, or ATB for short, is a tool for benchmarking trust and reputation models. It is intended to be used by trust and reputation researchers.

ATB allows researchers to easily implement new trust models, evaluation scenarios, and benchmark metrics. These implementations can then be shared to enable straightforward comparison between various trust and reputation models.
